What is the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python?
==================================================

The Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python is used by data scientists and AI developers 
to build and run machine learning workflows upon the Azure Machine Learning service. 
You can interact with the service in any Python environment, including Jupyter Notebooks 
or your favorite Python IDE.

Use this SDK to quickly build, train, and deploy your machine learning and deep learning 
models for various domains.

Azure Machine Learning service stores free form text that the customer provides (e.g. names
for workspaces, resource groups, experiments, files, and images) or experiment parameters 
in the United States.
